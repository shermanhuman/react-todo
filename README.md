# React Todo List with Vite

A simple Todo List application built using React and Vite. It demonstrates how to set up a basic React project with Vite, manage state with hooks, and handle user input.  It was built following [this Youtube tutorial by Webdev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh3tobg7hEo&t=68s).
